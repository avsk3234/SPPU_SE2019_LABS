# SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-AI&DS-OS-Practicals

Group A Practicals :

os-1) Given the list of processes, their CPU burst times. Display/print the Gantt chart for FCFS , SJF , Priority and Round 
      Robin scheduling algorithm. Compute and print the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

os-2) Implement producer-consumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex.

os-3) Demonstrate Reader-Writer problem with reader priority or writer.

os-4) Write a program to implement the Bankers Algorithm.

os-5) Write a program to implement page Replacement strategies (FIFO, LRU,Optimal).

Group B Practicals :

os-6) Create a shell program to do mathematical operations.

os-7) Create a shell program to find string in a file using grep system call.

Group C Practicals :

os-8) Inter process communication in Linux using Pipes 
      Pipes: Full duplex communication between parent and child processes. Parent process writes a pathname of a file (the contents of the file are desired) on one pipe to be read by child process and child process writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by parent process and displays on standard output.
