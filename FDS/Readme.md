# SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-AI&DS-Data-Structures-Practicals

Group A Practicals :

dsa-1) In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C 
       students play football.
       Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
				a)	List of students who play both cricket and badminton
				b)	List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
				c)	Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
				d)	Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
		(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built- in functions)

dsa-2) 	Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N students in the class. Write 			functions to compute following:
				a)	The average score of class
				b)	Highest score and lowest score of class
				c)	Count of students who were absent for the test
				d)	Display mark with highest frequency

dsa-5)  Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
				a)	To display word with the longest length
				b)	To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
				c)	To check whether given string is palindrome or not
				d)	To display index of first appearance of the substring
				e)	To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

Group B Practicals :

dsa-11) a) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training program in random order. Write 
		function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.
		b) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

dsa-14) Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating 	
		point numbers in ascending order using
				a)	Selection Sort
				b)	Bubble sort and display top five scores

dsa-16) Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating
		point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display top five scores.
 
Group C Practicals :

dsa-19) Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third and final year of
        department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
				a)	Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
				b)	Compute total number of members of club
				c)	Display members
				d)	Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

dsa-20) The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program. There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each
        row. Doubly circular linked list has to be maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand
				a)	The list of available seats is to be displayed
				b)	The seats are to be booked
				c)	The booking can be cancelled.

Group D Practicals :

dsa-26) In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[]. Write C++ program using
        stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or not.

dsa-27(evaluvation & infixtopostfix) Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation using
				stack based on given conditions:
				1. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
				2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
				3. Only '+','-',and'/' operators are excepted.

Group E Practicals :

dsa-30) Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the items in the queue. Create a class that 
		includes the data items (which should be template) and the priority (which should be int). The inorder list should contain these objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.) 

dsa-31) A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. Obtain a data 
		representation mapping a deque into a one-dimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.

dsa-32) Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served basis. Order once placed cannot be 
		cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system using circular queue using array.
